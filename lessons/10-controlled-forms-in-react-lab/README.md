Welcome to Reactville, a constantly evolving virtual metropolis. Let's build this digital town together, one component at a time.

## About

The local library is adding a feature to their website where users can add their favorite books to a virtual bookshelf. You're going to help built the front end UI to make it happen!

You will develop a single component named `BookShelf` that contains both the controlled form and the display of the bookshelf. Using the `useState` hook, you will manage the form inputs and list of books, enabling real-time updates to the UI based on user input.

By the end of this lab, you'll have a functional application where users can add books to a personalized bookshelf, with each new entry updating the display immediatelyâ€”no page reloads required!
