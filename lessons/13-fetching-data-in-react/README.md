# ![Fetching Data in React](./assets/hero.png)

## About

In this module, students will learn how to fetch data from an API and display it in a React application. They will learn how to use the `fetch` API to make requests to a server and how to handle the response. They will also learn how to use `useEffect` to fetch data when a component mounts and how to use `useState` to store the data in the component's state.

## Prerequisites

- ~~Intro to Asynchronous Programming~~
- Controlled Forms in React
