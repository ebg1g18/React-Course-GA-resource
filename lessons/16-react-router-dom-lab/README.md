## About

Welcome to Reactville's local post office! In this lab, you'll develop an application that simulates the management of post office boxes. Features will include creating new mailboxes, viewing a list of all mailboxes, and exploring individual mailbox details.

![Solution UI Example](./assets/solution-ui-1.png)

Throughout the lab, you'll use client-side routing tools from `react-router-dom` to navigate between different components. This approach allows your single-page application to function more like a traditional multi-page website, improving the user experience by providing distinct navigable pages without full page reloads.
