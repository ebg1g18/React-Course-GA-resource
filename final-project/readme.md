# Final project brief

The final project is to build a React app of your choice. This project will test your knowledge of React front-end web development and encapsulate everything you've learned in this course. The result will be a React application that you can run and showcase on your local machine.

The objective of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of React's core concepts:

- Conditional rendering
- Component re utilisation
- Client routing using React Router
- Shared state across different components

## Core requirements

- A working React application you can run on your local machine
- Dynamic routing using React Router

## Deliverables

A three to five-minute presentation/showcase of your React Project to the rest of the class.

## Scope / Expectations

We suggest starting with a single page of an application and the build upon that.

Following industry best practices for clean and readable code is advised but not essential.

The goal is not to write perfect, professional code; it's to build something that you want to build so you have something tangible to show for your new skills.

### Out of scope

- Server
- Styling
- Deployment

## Grading

There is no grade or mark, or pass or fail.
Use the project as an opportunity to create something YOU want. Experiment with what we've learned, and have fun!

## Time commitment

At most, three hours.
